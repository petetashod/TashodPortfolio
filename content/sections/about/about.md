Learning how to code was always a passion of mine. It started with writing command line code at a career center in Highschool to writing Html and Css in College. I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant, functional solutions through the art of programming. For me, writing code isn't just a skill; it's a way to bring creativity to life in the digital realm and contribute meaningfully to the world of technology.
